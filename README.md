# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. I use [RCM](https://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm) to manage them.

## Installing
With RCM, you can initially link files with `rcup -x "README.md *zsh\*`

This will link all of the files but this readme and the zsh configuration directory, which doesn't need to be linked.
